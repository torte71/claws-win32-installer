This is the GUI Installer Builder for Claws Mail W32.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Configure the source tree for cross compilation:

   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w32

3. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available in two files:

src/claws-mail-X.Y.Z-R.exe
src/claws-mail-src-X.Y.Z-R.exe


Basic requirements
==================

A decent POSIX system is required for building this software as well
as GNU make.  We are using Debian GNU/Linux 9 (Stretch), any other
POSIX system should work as well but you may run into problems due to
different toolchain versions.

To satisfy all needs of configure at least the following packages need
to be installed:

***AKacian: This list is not necessarily up to date***

build-essential (libc6-dev, gcc, g++, make)
 automake 1.11, autoconf (if building from GIT)
 mingw-w64
 mingw-w64-i686-dev
 mingw-w64-x86-64-dev
 nsis
 stow
 unzip
 texinfo
 imagemagick
 gs-common (gs)
 docbook-utils
 sharutils (uudecode for claws icon patch)
 gettext (msgfmt, dcgettext, gmsgfmt, xgettext for glib)
 libglib2.0-dev (glib-genmarshal, glib-compile-{resources,schemas})
 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev (gdk-pixbuf-csource)
 docbook-utils, ghostscript (claws-mail manual)
 texlive (you need most modules)
 texlive-latex-extra
 latex-xcolor (for the compendium)
 libqt4-dev-bin (in case pinentry-qt needs moc)


Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================
***AKacian: This list is not necessarily up to date***

This requires editing a couple of files; we might eventually automate
some of these tasks.  Here is a short run up:

1. Add constants for the package FOO into include/config.nsi.in .

2. Create 2 new installer scripts, named src/inst-foo.nsi and
   uninst-foo.nsi and add them to EXTRA_DIST in src/Makefile.am.

3. Add foo to one the variables gpg4win_bpgks (if foo should not be
   build be the gpg4win) or gpg4win_spkgs (if foo should be build by
   gpg4win) in src/Makefile.am .  Also add any required configure
   flags etc.

4. Add FOO to inst-sections.nsi.

5. Add detection of packages to configure.ac.  Check out the available
   macros in m4/gpg4win.m4.  Depending on the way an upstream package
   is packaged, you might need to write a new macro.

6. Add download information to packages/download.sh.

7. If the package ships pkg-config (*.pc) support files, you need add
   post install instructions to Makefile.am.  Note that *.pc files may
   be in the "runtime" directory ${pkgidir} if the package is built
   within gpg4win (or peculiarly shipped), or in the development
   package ${pkgidir_dev}.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.

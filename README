This is the GUI Installer Builder for Claws Mail W32.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Configure the source tree for cross compilation, for either
   32-bit or 64-bit release:

   $ ./autogen.sh

   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w32
	 or
   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w64

3. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available in two files:

src/claws-mail-X.Y.Z-R.exe
src/claws-mail-src-X.Y.Z-R.exe

To collect files with debug symbols:

$ find src/playground/install/pkgs/ -name '*.debug' | grep /bin/ | xargs zip -j debug-files.zip


Basic requirements
==================

A decent POSIX system is required for building this software as well
as GNU make.  We are using Debian GNU/Linux 10 (Buster), any other
POSIX system should work as well but you may run into problems due to
different toolchain versions (MinGW gcc-8 is required, gcc-9 works more
or less and gcc-10 doesn't work yet).

To finish the build, following packages need to be installed on a
Debian Buster system.

Note - at the time of writing, the meson package in Debian Buster
(currently 0.49.1) is too old, see below for update instructions.

Building the gtk3 version has additional requirements (see below).

automake
autoconf
mingw-w64
nsis
stow
unzip
texinfo
imagemagick
docbook-utils
libglib2.0-dev
libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev
ghostscript
git
binutils
make
cmake
bison
flex
gperf
intltool
gcc
g++
libtool
libgettextpo-dev
meson
pkg-config-mingw-w64-x86-64
gobject-introspection
wget
gpg
sudo

Building in a Docker container
==============================

A good way to create an isolated environment for the build is to
use a Docker container. An image built from following Dockerfile
is sufficient:

--------8<---------8<---------8<--------
FROM debian:buster
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install automake autoconf mingw-w64 nsis stow unzip texinfo imagemagick docbook-utils libglib2.0-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev ghostscript git binutils make cmake bison flex gperf intltool gcc g++ libtool libgettextpo-dev meson pkg-config-mingw-w64-x86-64 gobject-introspection wget gpg sudo && apt-get clean
--------8<---------8<---------8<--------

To build the image locally (run in the directory with Dockerfile
with above content:
# docker image build -t claws-win32-builder:0.1 .

To launch a container based on the image, with the claws-win32-installer
cloned repository mounted inside it:
# docker run -ti --name mybuilder \
  -v /path/to/claws-win32-installer:/build \
	claws-win32-builder:0.1

In the shell inside the running container, switch to /build directory
and build the Claws Mail package according to the instructions above
in this README files.

Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================

This requires editing a couple of files.

1. Add package to toplevel configure.ac, stating its dependencies.

2. Add download information to packages/packages.current.

3. Add variables cm_pkg_<package>_configure, cm_pkg_<package_make_args
   to src/Makefile.am. Also add the package to cm_spkgs in same file.

4. Specify what files from the built package should be included in
   the installation (and uninstallation) in src/sections-(un)installer.nsi.

5. If the package ships pkg-config (*.pc) support files, you need add
   post install instructions to Makefile.am.  Note that *.pc files may
   be in the "runtime" directory ${pkgidir} if the package is built
   within Claws Mail (or peculiarly shipped), or in the development
   package ${pkgidir_dev}.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.

If the package is using cmake, set pkg_cm_<package>_cmake to "yes",
and optionally set pkg_cm_<package>_cmake_args. Libical is an example
to follow.


SASL and unofficial patches
===========================

In order for libsasl2 to find its plugins (which we install into
$INSTDIR\lib\sasl2), I've had to add a new API function to libetpan,
mailsasl_set_plugin_path(), which in turn calls sasl_set_path().

We call this new function from Claws Mail's main() during initialization.

This is done via patches held in this repository, since this stuff can
not go upstream - or at least the Claws Mail patch shouldn't, until
libetpan provides some way to set the SASL plugin path. I'll consider
submitting the libetpan patch upstream later.


Updating meson
==============

Currently, the minimum required version of meson is 0.55.
Debian 10 (Buster) and Ubuntu 20 (Focal) ship with older versions and need
additional steps to update to a recent version:

* Debian 10 (Buster):
  Add following line to "/etc/apt/sources.list":
    deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster-backports main
  Then execute
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install -t buster-backports meson

* Ubuntu 20 (Focal)
  Manually download and install the meson package:
    wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/m/meson/meson_0.57.0+really0.56.2-0.1_all.deb
    dpkg -i meson_0.57.0+really0.56.2-0.1_all.deb


Building the gtk3 version
=========================

The gtk3 version needs icons from adwaita-icon-theme, which requires
"icontool-render" (from package "icontool") and "gtk-encode-symbolic-svg"
(from package "gtk-3-examples" on Debian or "libgtk-3-bin" on Ubuntu).
The package "icontool" is not available on Debian (AFAIK) and has to be
compiled from source (depends on libxml-simple-perl).

The binary packages of adwaita-icon-theme (that I know) don't contain
the required icons from the 16x16/ui folder, so this is no option
(e.g. window-close-symbolic.symbolic.png is missing).

Following steps are required (in addition to the apt-get packages
listed in the docker section above):

  sudo apt-get install -y inkscape gtk-3-examples libxml-simple-perl

On Ubuntu you can simply install icontool:

  sudo apt-get install -y icontool

On Debian, you have to manually fetch and compile icontool:

  wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/i/icontool/icontool_0.1.0.orig.tar.gz
  tar -xvaf icontool_0.1.0.orig.tar.gz
  cd icontool-0.1.0
  ./configure && make && sudo make install

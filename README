This is the GUI Installer Builder for Claws Mail W32.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Configure the source tree for cross compilation, for either
   32-bit or 64-bit release:

   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w32
	 or
   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w64

3. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available in two files:

src/claws-mail-X.Y.Z-R.exe
src/claws-mail-src-X.Y.Z-R.exe

To collect files with debug symbols:

$ find src/playground/install/pkgs/ -name '*.debug' | grep /bin/ | xargs zip -j debug-files.zip


Basic requirements
==================

A decent POSIX system is required for building this software as well
as GNU make.  We are using Debian GNU/Linux 9 (Stretch), any other
POSIX system should work as well but you may run into problems due to
different toolchain versions.

To satisfy all needs of configure at least the following packages need
to be installed:

***AKacian: This list is not necessarily up to date***

build-essential (libc6-dev, gcc, g++, make)
 automake 1.11, autoconf
 mingw-w64
 mingw-w64-i686-dev
 mingw-w64-x86-64-dev
 nsis
 stow
 unzip
 texinfo
 imagemagick
 gs-common (gs)
 docbook-utils
 gettext (msgfmt, dcgettext, gmsgfmt, xgettext for glib)
 libglib2.0-dev (glib-genmarshal, glib-compile-{resources,schemas})
 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev (gdk-pixbuf-csource)
 docbook-utils, ghostscript (claws-mail manual)


Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================

This requires editing a couple of files.

1. Add package to toplevel configure.ac, stating its dependencies.

2. Add download information to packages/packages.current.

3. Add variables cm_pkg_<package>_configure, cm_pkg_<package_make_args
   to src/Makefile.am. Also add the package to cm_spkgs in same file.

4. Specify what files from the built package should be included in
   the installation (and uninstallation) in src/sections-(un)installer.nsi.

5. If the package ships pkg-config (*.pc) support files, you need add
   post install instructions to Makefile.am.  Note that *.pc files may
   be in the "runtime" directory ${pkgidir} if the package is built
   within Claws Mail (or peculiarly shipped), or in the development
   package ${pkgidir_dev}.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.

If the package is using cmake, set pkg_cm_<package>_cmake to "yes",
and optionally set pkg_cm_<package>_cmake_args. Libical is an example
to follow.


SASL and unofficial patches
===========================

In order for libsasl2 to find its plugins (which we install into
$INSTDIR\lib\sasl2), I've had to add a new API function to libetpan,
mailsasl_set_plugin_path(), which in turn calls sasl_set_path().

We call this new function from Claws Mail's main() during initialization.

This is done via patches held in this repository, since this stuff can
not go upstream - or at least the Claws Mail patch shouldn't, until
libetpan provides some way to set the SASL plugin path. I'll consider
submitting the libetpan patch upstream later.

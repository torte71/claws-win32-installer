This is the GUI Installer Builder for Claws Mail W32.

Instructions:
=============

1. Download the source and binary packages that are required to build
   the installer:

   $ cd packages
   $ sh download.sh
   [...]
   $ cd ..

2. Configure the source tree for cross compilation:

   $ ./autogen.sh --build-w32

3. Build the installer:

   $ make

The installer will be made available in two files:

src/claws-mail-X.Y.Z-R.exe
src/claws-mail-src-X.Y.Z-R.exe


Basic requirements
==================

A decent POSIX system is required for building this software as well
as GNU make.  We are using Debian GNU/Linux 9 (Stretch), any other
POSIX system should work as well but you may run into problems due to
different toolchain versions.

To satisfy all needs of configure at least the following packages need
to be installed:

***AKacian: This list is not necessarily up to date***

build-essential (libc6-dev, gcc, g++, make)
 automake 1.11, autoconf (if building from GIT)
 mingw-w64
 mingw-w64-i686-dev
 mingw-w64-x86-64-dev
 nsis
 stow
 unzip
 texinfo
 imagemagick
 gs-common (gs)
 docbook-utils
 sharutils (uudecode for claws icon patch)
 gettext (msgfmt, dcgettext, gmsgfmt, xgettext for glib)
 libglib2.0-dev (glib-genmarshal, glib-compile-{resources,schemas})
 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev (gdk-pixbuf-csource)
 docbook-utils, ghostscript (claws-mail manual)
 texlive (you need most modules)
 texlive-latex-extra
 latex-xcolor (for the compendium)
 libqt4-dev-bin (in case pinentry-qt needs moc)


Adding new packages to the installer:
=====================================

This requires editing a couple of files.

1. Add package to toplevel configure.ac, stating its dependencies.

2. Add download information to packages/packages.current.

3. Add variables cm_pkg_<package>_configure, cm_pkg_<package_make_args
   to src/Makefile.am. Also add the package to cm_spkgs in same file.

4. Specify what files from the built package should be included in
   the installation (and uninstallation) in src/sections-(un)installer.nsi.

5. If the package ships pkg-config (*.pc) support files, you need add
   post install instructions to Makefile.am.  Note that *.pc files may
   be in the "runtime" directory ${pkgidir} if the package is built
   within Claws Mail (or peculiarly shipped), or in the development
   package ${pkgidir_dev}.

Then run the usual "./autogen.sh" to create the actual configure file
and run configure as described above.

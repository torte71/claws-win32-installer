Installation Instructions
*************************

The build has been tested on Debian 8.0 (Jessie) and 9.0 (Stretch). It
will likely work on other Linux distributions also, if the necessary
tools are installed. About 6GB of disk space will be needed.

First, following packages need to be installed:

apt-get install \
mingw-w64 gcc automake make unzip stow nsis gettext libgettextpo-dev \
graphicsmagick-imagemagick-compat pkg-config libglib2.0-dev bison flex \
libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev intltool gperf docbook-utils libswitch-perl

These packages will pull in lot of other packages as dependencies, around
400MB in total.

Important: If you are on Debian Stretch, you need to make sure older
mingw-w64 version 3.x is installed, as mingw-w64 versions 4.x come with
a broken libstdc++. Use Debian snapshot archive if needed.
See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=736946 for details.

If your flex version is less than 2.60, delete file
patches/webkit-1.3.10/03-maketokenizer-flex2.60.patch.

Latest installer source can be found in git repository, if building from
a release tarball (claws-mail-win32-x.y.z-N.tar.bz2) is not what you want:
  git clone http://git.claws-mail.org/readonly/claws-win32-installer.git
	cd claws-win32-installer

Download source code for all the software we will be building:
  cd packages
	sh download.sh
	cd ..

Prepare the tree for building:
  ./autogen.sh
	./autogen.sh --build-w32

And finally, if everything is in its place, start the build with:
  make

Do not use -j switch for make, the build system will automatically add it
to make commands for individual software packages, based on number of CPUs
on your system.

The build will take a long time, possibly over an hour. As already mentioned,
It will require about 6GB of disk space.

When all is done, the installer .exe can be found in src/ subdirectory. If
you also want to build the sources, you can do so with command:
  make dist
